# webp-recompress

A (totally not production-ready) Node.js program that takes an input JPEG and uses [SSIMULACRA](https://github.com/cloudinary/ssimulacra) to generate a lossy WebP within a specified quality range. It works on macOS Catalina currently, but probably won't work on other platforms until I can get some stuff figured out.

If you have SSIMULACRA available locally, try installing `webp-recompress` globally:

```
npm i -g webp-recompress
```

Then type `webp-recompress` to get the help text.

More documentation to follow once this project has matured a bit.
