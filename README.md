# webp-equiv

A (totally not ready) Node.js program that takes an input image and uses [SSIMULACRA](https://github.com/cloudinary/ssimulacra) to generate a lossy WebP within a specified quality range.

In order to run this, you'll need SSIMULACRA available on your system. There is currently no installable package for it on npm.
